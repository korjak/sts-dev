However, in many parts of the world many vaccine-preventable diseases that are rarely seen in the United States are still common.
4578	Claim 8.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
4805	Vaccines should be mandatory with no philosophical, medical or religious exemptions.	Without insulin, the body cannot process and use glucose, a blood sugar which is a chief source of energy for living organisms and is found in certain foods like fruit.

This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].
5794	It has been estimated that as many as 62% of children with autism experience a period of regression during early childhood, characterized by loss of previously acquired skills [5].	As can be observed, there is no statistically significant effect for any of the subclasses in either gender or age cut-off for MMR uptake.
2177	A greater awareness of the condition among health professionals also has led to more diagnoses.	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.
517	When the body’s immune system is activated this intensely, it also intensely activates the brain’s immune system (the microglia).	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.

784	Severe reactions to these vaccines, especially if they again receive five vaccines at once, runs a very high risk of severe neurological injury, possibly seizures, during the first two weeks after the vaccines.	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.
4487	The expansion of genetic studies has found that, in families who have two children diagnosed with autism, the siblings often don’t share the same gene changes, which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn’t inherited even when it runs in families.	For many years, public health advocates have vainly urged the CDC and WHO to conduct studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations to measure overall health outcomes.
7470	Half of all amputations performed in the US are caused by diabetes, which means that about 54,000 amputations are diabetes-related.	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.
5670	Is there any scientific evidence of a connection between vaccines and autism?	Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979 and from the Western hemisphere in 1991.
6054	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.
1065	Medical professionals gather copayments for unique office check outs to inject shots, and there have been assertions that these medical professionals really benefit handsomely from these vaccinations.	Babies infected with the rubella virus in their mother's womb, who are born with congenitally acquired rubella syndrome, often develop Type I diabetes.
7002	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.	It's found it is a distressingly common diagnosis with somewhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 68 kids having the condition.
379	In another paper published in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in 2003 (Vol 6, 21-35) I go into a lot more scientific detail explaining the immunological and neurological mechanism for this injury.

4562	Claim 8.	Without insulin, the body cannot process and use glucose, a blood sugar which is a chief source of energy for living organisms and is found in certain foods like fruit.
658	Numerous instances of neurological, devastating injuries occurring with the second or third injection series have been recorded n the medical literature.	There are very real problems with vaccine safety, efficacy, pharmaceutical influence in public interest decision making and policy, and conflicts of interest among the regulators of our government agencies expected to protect Americans from harm.
2753	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.
5768	For example, persons with severe immunocompromising conditions—such as leukemia or untreated AIDS, or those who have had a bone marrow transplant—should not receive live vaccines.	There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.
7043	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.

5079	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.	(6) Hooker also obtained an abstract that reads “increased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life.” (7) Another fishy finding with regards to vaccinations (as I’ve mentioned many times before) comes from Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD from the Dept.
4854	Surely all this immune stimulation is overloading their little bodies, right?	Within this study, the age at the first MMR vaccine was assessed as a factor in the incidence of autism.
2068	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.
3988	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.	It's paid for by a tax on vaccines.
953	Sound arguments can be made that these children not receive any of these vacations, especially as they have been given.	So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.

2270	The number of SIDS cases has actually fallen by more than 50% in recent years, whereas the number of vaccines given yearly has continued to rise.	This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].
5607	Vaccine effectiveness can be higher or lower for subpopulations depending on their ability to fully respond to the vaccine.	In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.
6538	When they enter the birth canal and the world, however, they are bombarded with bacteria.	This research is particularly important for individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to autoimmunity, such as those with a family history of autoimmune disease.
3584	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.
1515	No, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chickenpox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or is exposed to it through a vaccine.	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
2954	They say the “insatiable pharmaceutical industry” has 271 new vaccines under development at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the hope of raising annual vaccine sales to $100 billion.

Some clergy believed that the vaccine went against their religion.
2257	The number of SIDS cases has actually fallen by more than 50% in recent years, whereas the number of vaccines given yearly has continued to rise.	They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations.
6839	Though there are more vaccinations than ever before, today's vaccines are far more efficient.	Half of all amputations performed in the US are caused by diabetes, which means that about 54,000 amputations are diabetes-related.

16	TUCSON, Ariz., Dec.  07, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As early as 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had data showing an increased rate of autism diagnoses in black male schoolchildren in Atlanta who received their first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination before 36 months of age, compared with those who received it later, writes Brian Hooker, Ph.D., in the winter issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.

1233	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	There was also the STEP study in which some men who received a vaccine designed to protect against HIV ended up at higher risk of being infected by the virus.
4940	Other parents delay or decline immuniza­tions due to worries that family history, the child’s premature birth, or an underlying medical condi­tion may make them more vulnerable to compli­cations.	However, the CDC’s dataset included controls as young as 3 years of age who could have been “too young” to receive an autism diagnosis.

7503	Babies infected with the rubella virus in their mother's womb, who are born with congenitally acquired rubella syndrome, often develop Type I diabetes.	When people mistrust science, they’re less likely to vaccinate.
3844	Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) was taken out of vaccines in 1999 and autism rates still continued to rise.	As can be observed, there is no statistically significant effect for any of the subclasses in either gender or age cut-off for MMR uptake.
7183	That said, your priority as a parent is, understandably, protecting your child from harm in any way that you can.	Data reaffirm vaccine safety The results of the study led researchers to conclude that, in most cases, revaccination is safe after an adverse reaction.
5246	This is one example of many.	The reason that children are immunized early in life is to protect them against diseases that occur early in life.
6090	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
5328	They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age.	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
5853	It has been estimated that as many as 62% of children with autism experience a period of regression during early childhood, characterized by loss of previously acquired skills [5].	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.

1886	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	Researchers have been unable to find evidence thimerosal in vaccines can damage human brains – it’s in a form the body processes quickly -- but drugmakers took it out of all childhood vaccines anyway years ago because of the fears.
1436	The reality is that vaccinations play a vital role in keeping kids healthy.

40	TUCSON, Ariz., Dec.  07, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As early as 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had data showing an increased rate of autism diagnoses in black male schoolchildren in Atlanta who received their first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination before 36 months of age, compared with those who received it later, writes Brian Hooker, Ph.D., in the winter issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.	There is no epidemic because changing diagnostic criteria explains the rise.
1432	The reality is that vaccinations play a vital role in keeping kids healthy.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..
6456	Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.	These include: Autism The belief that vaccines can cause autism has become widespread in the past few years.

1251	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	Surely all this immune stimulation is overloading their little bodies, right?

7028	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.	So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.
1811	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	The expansion of genetic studies has found that, in families who have two children diagnosed with autism, the siblings often don’t share the same gene changes, which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn’t inherited even when it runs in families.
7295	“The safety profile of vaccines is generally excellent, but some children experience local or systemic reactions following immunization, most of which are not serious,” De Serres says.	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.

5306	They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age.	It has been estimated that as many as 62% of children with autism experience a period of regression during early childhood, characterized by loss of previously acquired skills [5].

3678	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
1084	Medical professionals gather copayments for unique office check outs to inject shots, and there have been assertions that these medical professionals really benefit handsomely from these vaccinations.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..
1485	No, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chickenpox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or is exposed to it through a vaccine.	This is one example of many.

2718	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
6963	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.
6421	Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.

1300	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	Then, in 1976, the pertussis vaccine used in Finland was made stronger by adding a second strain of bacteria.

79	TUCSON, Ariz., Dec.  07, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As early as 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had data showing an increased rate of autism diagnoses in black male schoolchildren in Atlanta who received their first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination before 36 months of age, compared with those who received it later, writes Brian Hooker, Ph.D., in the winter issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.
5058	More than 16,000 Americans children were paralyzed by polio in the 20th century.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.
3440	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.	If you have concerns about a vaccination for you or your child, talk with a doctor that you trust and get their opinion.
5961	Use of the CDC specifically for the study described herein was approved by the Simpson University Institutional Review Board, in accordance with U.S. Federal regulations.	At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.
4823	Vaccines should be mandatory with no philosophical, medical or religious exemptions.	However, in many parts of the world many vaccine-preventable diseases that are rarely seen in the United States are still common.
1525	No, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chickenpox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or is exposed to it through a vaccine.	The pancreas still produces insulin in Type II diabetes but the body's cells are resistant to the action of insulin and glucose is not absorbed properly by the cells.
7562	Then, in 1976, the pertussis vaccine used in Finland was made stronger by adding a second strain of bacteria.	Even so, the CDC states that thimerosal does not cause autism.
7790	There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.	If you have concerns about a vaccination for you or your child, talk with a doctor that you trust and get their opinion.
2720	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	For many years, public health advocates have vainly urged the CDC and WHO to conduct studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations to measure overall health outcomes.

4107	No guidelines have been established for INJECTING any form of mercury.	Within this study, the age at the first MMR vaccine was assessed as a factor in the incidence of autism.
5521	It comes after Trump—who has long been critical of vaccines—met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.	Use of the CDC specifically for the study described herein was approved by the Simpson University Institutional Review Board, in accordance with U.S. Federal regulations.

1852	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	Good news is typically classified as no news — which is why you don't hear a lot about it.
4989	Other parents delay or decline immuniza­tions due to worries that family history, the child’s premature birth, or an underlying medical condi­tion may make them more vulnerable to compli­cations.	It's found it is a distressingly common diagnosis with somewhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 68 kids having the condition.
2217	A greater awareness of the condition among health professionals also has led to more diagnoses.	This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases.
5207	In the process of doing this, the other 90% or more of children have their immune system over stimulated.	And it is rare for side effects to be serious.
4581	Claim 8.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.
545	When the body’s immune system is activated this intensely, it also intensely activates the brain’s immune system (the microglia).	This is one example of many.

3200	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.
6603	The reason that children are immunized early in life is to protect them against diseases that occur early in life.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

When people mistrust science, they’re less likely to vaccinate.
7670	So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.	This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases.
1860	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	Without insulin, the body cannot process and use glucose, a blood sugar which is a chief source of energy for living organisms and is found in certain foods like fruit.

5625	Vaccine effectiveness can be higher or lower for subpopulations depending on their ability to fully respond to the vaccine.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
6398	However, the CDC’s dataset included controls as young as 3 years of age who could have been “too young” to receive an autism diagnosis.	Some clergy believed that the vaccine went against their religion.

463	In another paper published in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in 2003 (Vol 6, 21-35) I go into a lot more scientific detail explaining the immunological and neurological mechanism for this injury.	The pancreas still produces insulin in Type II diabetes but the body's cells are resistant to the action of insulin and glucose is not absorbed properly by the cells.

Related: 7 Vaccine Myths Debunked The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) and various independent groups have debunked, often multiple times, every assertion made in the past 20 years by a small but highly vocal group of vaccine critics.
3463	In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that vaccines are “unavoidably unsafe.”.	They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations.

2204	A greater awareness of the condition among health professionals also has led to more diagnoses.	And it is rare for side effects to be serious.
6236	This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].	The reason that children are immunized early in life is to protect them against diseases that occur early in life.
5310	They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age.	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.
5547	It comes after Trump—who has long been critical of vaccines—met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.	“The safety profile of vaccines is generally excellent, but some children experience local or systemic reactions following immunization, most of which are not serious,” De Serres says.

Demographic data Demographic data including birthdate, gender and race were obtained for both case and control children via birth certificates or registration forms kept as a part of each child’s permanent school record.
3655	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.	For example, persons with severe immunocompromising conditions—such as leukemia or untreated AIDS, or those who have had a bone marrow transplant—should not receive live vaccines.

5476	(6) Hooker also obtained an abstract that reads “increased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life.” (7) Another fishy finding with regards to vaccinations (as I’ve mentioned many times before) comes from Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD from the Dept.	"How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:

7170	It's a long and appropriately complex process.	In contrast, just 57 claims of deaths due to measles vaccines have been filed through the U.S.
6954	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.

If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
4624	There are very real problems with vaccine safety, efficacy, pharmaceutical influence in public interest decision making and policy, and conflicts of interest among the regulators of our government agencies expected to protect Americans from harm.	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.
7012	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.	You can minimize your baby's pain and tears by holding her in your arms and by distracting her.
1343	The reality is that vaccinations play a vital role in keeping kids healthy.	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.

3031	They say the “insatiable pharmaceutical industry” has 271 new vaccines under development at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the hope of raising annual vaccine sales to $100 billion.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
3422	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.	And it is rare for side effects to be serious.
4697	Claim 10.	Demographic data Demographic data including birthdate, gender and race were obtained for both case and control children via birth certificates or registration forms kept as a part of each child’s permanent school record.
2678	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	Vaccine effectiveness can be higher or lower for subpopulations depending on their ability to fully respond to the vaccine.

7426	The pancreas still produces insulin in Type II diabetes but the body's cells are resistant to the action of insulin and glucose is not absorbed properly by the cells.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..
4141	No guidelines have been established for INJECTING any form of mercury.	This research is particularly important for individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to autoimmunity, such as those with a family history of autoimmune disease.
692	Numerous instances of neurological, devastating injuries occurring with the second or third injection series have been recorded n the medical literature.	Though there are more vaccinations than ever before, today's vaccines are far more efficient.

1882	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..
6413	Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.	In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.
5192	In the process of doing this, the other 90% or more of children have their immune system over stimulated.	Half of all amputations performed in the US are caused by diabetes, which means that about 54,000 amputations are diabetes-related.
6472	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.	Good news is typically classified as no news — which is why you don't hear a lot about it.
2670	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	More than 16,000 Americans children were paralyzed by polio in the 20th century.
2887	One of the first was Jenny McCarthy, the former Playboy Playmate, whose son was diagnosed with autism in 2005.	Demographic data Demographic data including birthdate, gender and race were obtained for both case and control children via birth certificates or registration forms kept as a part of each child’s permanent school record.
4896	Surely all this immune stimulation is overloading their little bodies, right?	At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.
3668	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.	When they enter the birth canal and the world, however, they are bombarded with bacteria.
7473	Babies infected with the rubella virus in their mother's womb, who are born with congenitally acquired rubella syndrome, often develop Type I diabetes.	This research is particularly important for individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to autoimmunity, such as those with a family history of autoimmune disease.
3559	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.	It comes after Trump—who has long been critical of vaccines—met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.
7299	Data reaffirm vaccine safety The results of the study led researchers to conclude that, in most cases, revaccination is safe after an adverse reaction.	Without insulin, the body cannot process and use glucose, a blood sugar which is a chief source of energy for living organisms and is found in certain foods like fruit.

6980	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.	Then, in 1976, the pertussis vaccine used in Finland was made stronger by adding a second strain of bacteria.
3231	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.
6483	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.	Babies infected with the rubella virus in their mother's womb, who are born with congenitally acquired rubella syndrome, often develop Type I diabetes.
2292	The number of SIDS cases has actually fallen by more than 50% in recent years, whereas the number of vaccines given yearly has continued to rise.

2692	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.
5121	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
4863	Surely all this immune stimulation is overloading their little bodies, right?	Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.
3900	Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) was taken out of vaccines in 1999 and autism rates still continued to rise.	This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases.
5751	For example, persons with severe immunocompromising conditions—such as leukemia or untreated AIDS, or those who have had a bone marrow transplant—should not receive live vaccines.	“The safety profile of vaccines is generally excellent, but some children experience local or systemic reactions following immunization, most of which are not serious,” De Serres says.
3966	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.

5536	It comes after Trump—who has long been critical of vaccines—met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.	None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.
6834	Though there are more vaccinations than ever before, today's vaccines are far more efficient.	“The safety profile of vaccines is generally excellent, but some children experience local or systemic reactions following immunization, most of which are not serious,” De Serres says.
2795	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.	When they enter the birth canal and the world, however, they are bombarded with bacteria.
1984	The most common reactions to vaccines are minor and include: soreness at the site where the shot was given.	There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.
575	When the body’s immune system is activated this intensely, it also intensely activates the brain’s immune system (the microglia).	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
6298	Gallagher et al.	None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.

5868	Within this study, the age at the first MMR vaccine was assessed as a factor in the incidence of autism.	Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979 and from the Western hemisphere in 1991.
3247	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	If you have concerns about a vaccination for you or your child, talk with a doctor that you trust and get their opinion.
1270	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	Table 4 Fisher’s exact analysis for African American children excluding low birth weight Discussion The results show a strong relationship between child age at the administration of the first MMR and autism incidence exclusively for African American boys which could indicate a role of the vaccine in the etiology of autism within this population group.

Data reaffirm vaccine safety The results of the study led researchers to conclude that, in most cases, revaccination is safe after an adverse reaction.
2085	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
7674	So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.	When people mistrust science, they’re less likely to vaccinate.

1788	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	The number of SIDS cases has actually fallen by more than 50% in recent years, whereas the number of vaccines given yearly has continued to rise.

At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.
2067	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.	In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.

There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.
3747	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.

6966	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
605	When the body’s immune system is activated this intensely, it also intensely activates the brain’s immune system (the microglia).	Today, most vaccines carry only trace amounts of it, according to the CDC.

So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.
5675	Is there any scientific evidence of a connection between vaccines and autism?	In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of this chemical, mercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful.

Researchers have been unable to find evidence thimerosal in vaccines can damage human brains – it’s in a form the body processes quickly -- but drugmakers took it out of all childhood vaccines anyway years ago because of the fears.
6370	However, the CDC’s dataset included controls as young as 3 years of age who could have been “too young” to receive an autism diagnosis.	The pancreas still produces insulin in Type II diabetes but the body's cells are resistant to the action of insulin and glucose is not absorbed properly by the cells.

So, choosing one vaccine over another wouldn’t be a reasonable choice; it would be an untenable choice—a Sophie’s Choice.
2024	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.

1906	The most common reactions to vaccines are minor and include: soreness at the site where the shot was given.	Kennedy said the numbers are backed up by the stories from thousands of parents who talk about the seizures and autism symptoms their children developed after receiving vaccines.
1627	This change has completely eliminated the possibility of polio disease being caused by immunization in the United States.	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.

7741	At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.	Some clergy believed that the vaccine went against their religion.
4126	No guidelines have been established for INJECTING any form of mercury.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.
4428	There is no epidemic because changing diagnostic criteria explains the rise.	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.
3048	They say the “insatiable pharmaceutical industry” has 271 new vaccines under development at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the hope of raising annual vaccine sales to $100 billion.	There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.
6408	Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.	Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979 and from the Western hemisphere in 1991.

2073	Likewise, a groundbreaking 2004 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that thimerosal (an organic mercury compound that's been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s) does not cause autism.	It's a long and appropriately complex process.
3163	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	The expansion of genetic studies has found that, in families who have two children diagnosed with autism, the siblings often don’t share the same gene changes, which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn’t inherited even when it runs in families.
398	In another paper published in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in 2003 (Vol 6, 21-35) I go into a lot more scientific detail explaining the immunological and neurological mechanism for this injury.

6227	Table 4 Fisher’s exact analysis for African American children excluding low birth weight Discussion The results show a strong relationship between child age at the administration of the first MMR and autism incidence exclusively for African American boys which could indicate a role of the vaccine in the etiology of autism within this population group.	Even so, the CDC states that thimerosal does not cause autism.
6991	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
5105	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.	In fact, in the small percentage (less than 1 in one million cases) where symptoms do occur, the vaccine recipients are experiencing a body's immune response to the vaccine, not the disease itself.
3362	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.	Other parents delay or decline immuniza­tions due to worries that family history, the child’s premature birth, or an underlying medical condi­tion may make them more vulnerable to compli­cations.
7276	“The safety profile of vaccines is generally excellent, but some children experience local or systemic reactions following immunization, most of which are not serious,” De Serres says.	There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.

1278	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979 and from the Western hemisphere in 1991.
3794	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.	Your pediatrician knows that you care about your child’s health and safety.

1752	In fact, the amount of germs in vaccines is just a small percentage of the germs babies' immune systems deal with every day.	Babies infected with the rubella virus in their mother's womb, who are born with congenitally acquired rubella syndrome, often develop Type I diabetes.
3936	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.	This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].
277	What isn’t highlighted is that in many cases, those side effects are expected as often as one out of every two individuals.	There was also the STEP study in which some men who received a vaccine designed to protect against HIV ended up at higher risk of being infected by the virus.
5431	They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..

67	TUCSON, Ariz., Dec.  07, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As early as 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had data showing an increased rate of autism diagnoses in black male schoolchildren in Atlanta who received their first measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination before 36 months of age, compared with those who received it later, writes Brian Hooker, Ph.D., in the winter issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.

1384	The reality is that vaccinations play a vital role in keeping kids healthy.	As can be observed, there is no statistically significant effect for any of the subclasses in either gender or age cut-off for MMR uptake.
1953	The most common reactions to vaccines are minor and include: soreness at the site where the shot was given.	Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979 and from the Western hemisphere in 1991.
5499	(6) Hooker also obtained an abstract that reads “increased risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life.” (7) Another fishy finding with regards to vaccinations (as I’ve mentioned many times before) comes from Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD from the Dept.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.

4960	Other parents delay or decline immuniza­tions due to worries that family history, the child’s premature birth, or an underlying medical condi­tion may make them more vulnerable to compli­cations.	Data reaffirm vaccine safety The results of the study led researchers to conclude that, in most cases, revaccination is safe after an adverse reaction.
1054	Medical professionals gather copayments for unique office check outs to inject shots, and there have been assertions that these medical professionals really benefit handsomely from these vaccinations.	Good news is typically classified as no news — which is why you don't hear a lot about it.
2656	Autism was first described in 1943 among children born in the 1930s.	Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) was taken out of vaccines in 1999 and autism rates still continued to rise.
1864	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	This research is particularly important for individuals who may have a genetic predisposition to autoimmunity, such as those with a family history of autoimmune disease.
3928	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.	For example, persons with severe immunocompromising conditions—such as leukemia or untreated AIDS, or those who have had a bone marrow transplant—should not receive live vaccines.
5523	It comes after Trump—who has long been critical of vaccines—met at Trump Tower with Kennedy, who has spearheaded efforts to roll back child vaccination laws.	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.

2836	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..
5832	It has been estimated that as many as 62% of children with autism experience a period of regression during early childhood, characterized by loss of previously acquired skills [5].	At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.
1320	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	In contrast, just 57 claims of deaths due to measles vaccines have been filed through the U.S.
6780	None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.	If someone were to carry in a disease from abroad, an unvaccinated individual will be at far greater risk of getting sick if he or she is exposed.
5099	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.	So, choosing one vaccine over another wouldn’t be a reasonable choice; it would be an untenable choice—a Sophie’s Choice.

3227	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	Your pediatrician knows that you care about your child’s health and safety.
351	What isn’t highlighted is that in many cases, those side effects are expected as often as one out of every two individuals.	At that time, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended DTP for mass use in children.
1764	In fact, the amount of germs in vaccines is just a small percentage of the germs babies' immune systems deal with every day.	Your pediatrician knows that you care about your child’s health and safety.
3133	Kennedy said the numbers are backed up by the stories from thousands of parents who talk about the seizures and autism symptoms their children developed after receiving vaccines.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.
2183	A greater awareness of the condition among health professionals also has led to more diagnoses.	"How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example: 
""in a high school of 1,000 students, none has ever had measles."
7575	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
1387	The reality is that vaccinations play a vital role in keeping kids healthy.	Gallagher et al.
3756	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.	Gallagher et al.
391	In another paper published in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in 2003 (Vol 6, 21-35) I go into a lot more scientific detail explaining the immunological and neurological mechanism for this injury.	Also make sure your kids get the flu vaccine each year.

4342	Other MMR studies prove no link as well.	Even so, the CDC states that thimerosal does not cause autism.
732	Numerous instances of neurological, devastating injuries occurring with the second or third injection series have been recorded n the medical literature.	It's found it is a distressingly common diagnosis with somewhere between 1 in 45 and 1 in 68 kids having the condition.
1481	No, the immune system makes antibodies against a germ, like the chickenpox virus, whether it encounters it naturally or is exposed to it through a vaccine.	Other parents delay or decline immuniza­tions due to worries that family history, the child’s premature birth, or an underlying medical condi­tion may make them more vulnerable to compli­cations.
7203	That said, your priority as a parent is, understandably, protecting your child from harm in any way that you can.	However, in many parts of the world many vaccine-preventable diseases that are rarely seen in the United States are still common.

Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.
4813	Vaccines should be mandatory with no philosophical, medical or religious exemptions.	For many years, public health advocates have vainly urged the CDC and WHO to conduct studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations to measure overall health outcomes.
6679	So, choosing one vaccine over another wouldn’t be a reasonable choice; it would be an untenable choice—a Sophie’s Choice.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.

6464	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.	So, choosing one vaccine over another wouldn’t be a reasonable choice; it would be an untenable choice—a Sophie’s Choice.
776	Severe reactions to these vaccines, especially if they again receive five vaccines at once, runs a very high risk of severe neurological injury, possibly seizures, during the first two weeks after the vaccines.	The expansion of genetic studies has found that, in families who have two children diagnosed with autism, the siblings often don’t share the same gene changes, which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn’t inherited even when it runs in families.
5800	It has been estimated that as many as 62% of children with autism experience a period of regression during early childhood, characterized by loss of previously acquired skills [5].	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.

6355	However, the CDC’s dataset included controls as young as 3 years of age who could have been “too young” to receive an autism diagnosis.	None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.
4885	Surely all this immune stimulation is overloading their little bodies, right?	The pancreas still produces insulin in Type II diabetes but the body's cells are resistant to the action of insulin and glucose is not absorbed properly by the cells.
5404	They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations.	That said, your priority as a parent is, understandably, protecting your child from harm in any way that you can.
5091	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.	This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].

1913	The most common reactions to vaccines are minor and include: soreness at the site where the shot was given.	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.
1742	In fact, the amount of germs in vaccines is just a small percentage of the germs babies' immune systems deal with every day.	You can minimize your baby's pain and tears by holding her in your arms and by distracting her.
6476	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.	"How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:

839	Severe reactions to these vaccines, especially if they again receive five vaccines at once, runs a very high risk of severe neurological injury, possibly seizures, during the first two weeks after the vaccines.	There may be mild side effects, like swelling where the shot was given, but they do not last long.
1690	In fact, the amount of germs in vaccines is just a small percentage of the germs babies' immune systems deal with every day.	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.
5358	They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age.	Today, most vaccines carry only trace amounts of it, according to the CDC.
307	What isn’t highlighted is that in many cases, those side effects are expected as often as one out of every two individuals.	For example, persons with severe immunocompromising conditions—such as leukemia or untreated AIDS, or those who have had a bone marrow transplant—should not receive live vaccines.
7201	That said, your priority as a parent is, understandably, protecting your child from harm in any way that you can.	To monitor the safety of vaccines after licensure, the FDA and the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.
3933	In the years after the phase out of mercury in the Hep B, Hib, and DTaP, children were increasingly being exposed to thimerosal through flu shots.	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.
4064	For women who received the H1N1 vaccine in both seasons covered in the study, the odds of spontaneous abortion in the 28 days after receving a flu vaccine was 7.7 times greater.	Your pediatrician knows that you care about your child’s health and safety.
2820	If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.	When babies with this sub-clinical inflammation are injected with vaccines, the existing inflammation is made worse by the release of interferon and causes an autoimmune state leading to immune mediated Type 1 diabetes later in childhood.
3349	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.	Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) was taken out of vaccines in 1999 and autism rates still continued to rise.

3788	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.	So, for example, a child born on January 1st and weighed on April 1st would be vaccinated, but a child born on February 1st would not be vaccinated until their following visit at age 5 months on July 1st.
7541	Then, in 1976, the pertussis vaccine used in Finland was made stronger by adding a second strain of bacteria.	All the infants were healthy at the time of vaccination.
5326	They showed that the correlation between ASD prevalence and the Aluminum adjuvant exposure appears to be the highest at 3-4 months of age.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.
298	What isn’t highlighted is that in many cases, those side effects are expected as often as one out of every two individuals.	In the United States for example since just 1999 children are scheduled to routinely receive over 80 additional vaccines over their childhood.
6241	This could be due to issues regarding vitamin D status with African Americans as it has been estimated that vitamin D sufficiency among whites is between 30-60% but is only 5-10% among African Americans [16].	Though there are more vaccinations than ever before, today's vaccines are far more efficient.
3192	They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.	This meant that children received only one inoculation in the first few years of life.
1667	This change has completely eliminated the possibility of polio disease being caused by immunization in the United States.	This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases.
3752	Ironically, many of today’s vaccines don’t actually prevent the vaccinated individual from harboring and transmitting the disease in question.	In the present study, frequencies of cases were determined for first MMR ages of less than versus greater than 18 months, 24 months and 36 months in each separate analysis.
1281	The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups.	None of them found a link between any vaccine and the likelihood of developing autism.
7325	Data reaffirm vaccine safety The results of the study led researchers to conclude that, in most cases, revaccination is safe after an adverse reaction.	Researchers have been unable to find evidence thimerosal in vaccines can damage human brains – it’s in a form the body processes quickly -- but drugmakers took it out of all childhood vaccines anyway years ago because of the fears.
3039	They say the “insatiable pharmaceutical industry” has 271 new vaccines under development at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the hope of raising annual vaccine sales to $100 billion.	Related: 7 Vaccine Myths Debunked The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) and various independent groups have debunked, often multiple times, every assertion made in the past 20 years by a small but highly vocal group of vaccine critics.
1142	In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free.	They determined that one of those triggers might be the “battery of vaccinations that young children receive.” Researchers found a positive and statistically significant relationship between autism and vaccinations.

Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.

6859	Though there are more vaccinations than ever before, today's vaccines are far more efficient.	Specifically, the review found strong evidence that several common vaccines for children — MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP), tetanus-diphtheria (Td), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B —are not associated with childhood leukemia..

1802	Few things in medicine work 100% of the time, but vaccines are one of the most effective weapons we have against disease — they work in 85% to 99% of cases.	Vaccinations produce herd immunity and prevent dangerous, even deadly, diseases.
4468	The expansion of genetic studies has found that, in families who have two children diagnosed with autism, the siblings often don’t share the same gene changes, which has raised the possibility that the disorder isn’t inherited even when it runs in families.	According to CDC data, the incidence rate for this malady plummeted from 20,000 in 1990 to around 1,500 in 1993, following the introduction of the vaccine.
665	Numerous instances of neurological, devastating injuries occurring with the second or third injection series have been recorded n the medical literature.	In the process of doing this, the other 90% or more of children have their immune system over stimulated.

It's a long and appropriately complex process.
963	Sound arguments can be made that these children not receive any of these vacations, especially as they have been given.	Herd immunity is the benefit everyone receives from a vaccinated population once immunization reaches a critical level.
4306	Other MMR studies prove no link as well.	"How these two factors work together to result in outbreaks in which the majority of cases have been vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:

Routine childhood vaccination is considered an important public health tool in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases.
1161	In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free.	The reason that children are immunized early in life is to protect them against diseases that occur early in life.
3365	Despite the sound science supporting these parent claims, government agencies and mainstream media continue issuing the now shopworn mantra that vaccines are “safe and effective” ignoring published research and even common sense that indicate otherwise.	In the process of doing this, the other 90% or more of children have their immune system over stimulated.
